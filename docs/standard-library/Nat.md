# `Nat`

Functions for converting between `nat` values and the ordinary integer
representation of the natural numbers.

The built-in `nat` type is defined as:

```
type nat
  = Zero
  | Succ(nat)
```

Note that it is not necessary to use `pack` explicitly when working with
numeric literals. For example, you can write:

```
let
  x : nat = 5
  in
```

and the compiler will perform the conversion automatically. This works
because numeric literals are overloaded.

### `pack`

Convert an `int64` value into a natural number.

Interpret the given integer as a natural number and return the
corresponding `nat` value. If the input is negative, the function
will return `Zero`.

```coal
pack : int64 -> nat
```

---

### `unpack`

Convert a natural number into an `int64` value.

Return the integer representation of the given value as an `int64`.

```coal
unpack : nat -> int64
```
